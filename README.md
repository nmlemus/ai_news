# Flutter News App
Flutter news app using Parse server as a backend

# Create the project

## Step 1. Create github repository with the name of the projects

This is something we can do directly into the GitHub website https://github.com/

## Step 2. Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/user_name/repo_name.git
```

## Step 3. Create the flutter project using GetX CLI

```shell
get create project
```

If you want to create the project inside the folder of the GitHub repo you need to use the same name at the time get ask you about the project name

## Step 4. Put back to GitHub your Initial commit

```shell
git add --all
git commit -m "Create Flutter structure using getx"
git push
```

If everything works ok now you are ready to continue the development of the project using GitHub as a version control and collaboration platform
